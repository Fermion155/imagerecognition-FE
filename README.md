## About The Project

Image recognition frontend is an application that provides a basic UI for image recognition application.

This service uses Amazon Rekognition service to recognize the received images and decide if it is **ALLOWED** or **NOT_ALLOWED** to be used somewhere. The option that the image was **NOT_RECOGNIZED** can also be returned by this UI in case none of the labels returned by Amazon Rekognition match the ones saved in the database.
